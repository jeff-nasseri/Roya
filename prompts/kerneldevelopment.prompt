Design a series of function signatures that implement features from the provided feature file, with detailed documentation:

1. For each function, provide:
   - Complete function signature (parameters and return type)
   - XML summary documentation that clearly explains the function's purpose
   - Semantic Kernel attribute annotations that will help LLMs understand the function

2. Include specific Semantic Kernel requirements:
   - Add [KernelFunction] attributes with appropriate descriptions
   - Include [Description] attributes for parameters
   - Use appropriate [SKFunction] annotations where needed
   - Follow Microsoft's latest Semantic Kernel library conventions

3. Organization:
   - Group related functions into separate files with logical naming
   - Structure the code to follow Semantic Kernel plugin architecture
   - Indicate which namespace each function should belong to

4. Important notes:
   - Do NOT implement function bodies - only signatures and documentation
   - I will provide unit tests later to verify your function signatures
   - Match function names, parameters, and return types to align with unit tests

5. For Semantic Kernel attributes, explain:
   - Why each attribute was chosen
   - How the attribute helps the LLM understand the function's purpose
   - What metadata the attribute provides to the Semantic Kernel runtime
